First page => Choose search or input text file
    Second page if search => search the song

Next page => Choose phonenumber or name and input it. Choose by line or by word. Choose auto text + time delay between texts or text on button press.

Once Text is complete, or back button is pressed -> go back to first page.


Stretch Goals:
- Have text sent in response to a received text (applescript should allow this)
