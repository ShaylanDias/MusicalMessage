[Intro]
Woo

[Verse 1]
Seen him in the club with nothin' but pretty tings
Probably think I'm a weirdo, can't stop starin' at his rings (Woo)
What kind of car was he driving? That shit was clean (Clean)
Tried to catch him outside, but he peeling off the scene
I wonder what it feel like to live his life just for a day
How he keep making his dreams come true and I can't? I'm starting to hate
Wonder if he capping when he say he counting up all day
Wonder if I start rapping if I could be like him one day

[Chorus]
He the one I hate the most, brown boy (Brown boy)
Makes me sick when you brag and boast, brown boy (Woo)
He could turn my wifey to a ho, brown boy (Yeah)
I don't know how he sell out shows, brown boy (Brown boy)
Engine roaring up the block, I heard the noise (It's brown boy)
Think I live around the corner from the brown boy (Oh no)
Who got these hoes paying attention? Brown boy (Yeah)
Probably came from a different dimension, brown boy (Yeah, yeah, woo)

[Verse 2]
I heard he be fucking with Thug and all his slimes (Yeah, yeah)
I know a girl that he be hitting from time to time (I know)
Man, fuck that ho, back in high school, she was mine (She was mine)
Shit, I'ma play it off like I don't mind (Woah, woah)
NAV said all he do is get up and grind (Woah, woah)
Fuck am I doing in school? I'm wasting time (Wasting time)
Swear if he get another plaque, I'll lose my mind (I'ma lose it)
I envy his life so much, I wish it was mine
Still live with my mom and dad, I hate them both (Both)
If I listen to the brown boy, I might get some hope (Hope)
He always gon' be there when there's nowhere for me to go
Can't deny his music, feel like drugs, I need a dose

[Chorus]
He the one I hate the most, brown boy (Brown boy)
Makes me sick when you brag and boast, brown boy (Woo)
He could turn my wifey to a ho, brown boy (Yeah)
I don't know how he sell out shows, brown boy (Brown boy)
Engine roaring up the block, I heard the noise (It's brown boy)
Think I live around the corner from the brown boy (Oh no)
Who got these hoes paying attention? Brown boy (Yeah)
Probably came from a different dimension, brown boy
